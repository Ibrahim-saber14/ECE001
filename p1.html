<h2>What is a Programming Languages</h2>

<h4> 
 A programming language is a programming language used by programmers to develop programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to implement.

Although many languages share similarities, each has its own composition. Once the programmer learns the rules of languages, structure, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. After that, the programmer often compiles the code into the machine language that the computer can understand. Script languages, which do not require a translator, use a translator to execute the script.</h4>
